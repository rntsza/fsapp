#  Full-Stack Application Development Test

  

##  Objective

  

The goal of this project is to develop a simple yet comprehensive full-stack application using React and Next.js. This application aims to showcase proficiency in building production-ready software, focusing on the frontend, backend, and testing aspects.

  

##  Requirements

  

###  Frontend

  

-  **Framework**: The application should be built using React and Next.js.

-  **User Interface**: Implement a user interface that displays account listings for checking and savings accounts, including the balances for each. It should also include an input field for currency amounts to be transferred.

-  **Functionality**: Users should be able to transfer funds between their checking and savings accounts using buttons designed for this purpose.

-  **Error Handling**: The UI should gracefully handle and display messages for common errors, such as insufficient funds or invalid input amounts.

  

###  Backend

  

-  **Server-Side Rendering**: Utilize Next.js capabilities for server-side rendering to enhance performance and SEO.

-  **Database**: Implement SQLite for data persistence on the backend, storing account data securely and efficiently.

  

###  Testing

  

-  **Unit Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure the application's reliability, focusing on comprehensive coverage to validate both frontend and backend functionality.

  

###  Version Control

  

-  **GitHub**: Commit your code to a GitHub repository and ensure it's publicly viewable to showcase your work effectively.

  

###  Optional Enhancements

  

- Consider implementing code coverage analysis to demonstrate the thoroughness of your testing strategy.

- Utilize a Next.js starter template to streamline the development process and maintain efficiency.

  

##  How to Run the Server
